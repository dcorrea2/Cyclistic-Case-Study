# Cyclistic-Case-Study
Case study to complete Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate


To complete the case study I used Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheets
A SQL based tool would have been better but they required payment for access and BiqQuery wouldn't allow large files for their free version.
Opted to just use spreadsheet tools instead
